# BCAI ART : Bosch Center for AI Adversarial Robustness Toolkit
This framework was used by the Bosch Center for AI while participating 
in the following program: [Guaranteeing AI Robustness Against Deception (GARD)](https://www.darpa.mil/program/guaranteeing-ai-robustness-against-deception)

## Purpose of the project

BCAI ART is a framework that provides core capabilities for 
training and testing models robust to a number of adversarial attacks.
This software is a research prototype, solely developed for and published as
part of the GARD program cited above. It will neither be
maintained nor monitored in any way.
